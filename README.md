Project Name: Smart Budget Tracker
Description
Budget Tracker is a simple, interactive Single Page Application (SPA) designed to help users manage their personal finances. It allows users to add income, track expenses, and set savings goals for specific purposes like emergencies, vacations, or projects. Users can visualize their savings progress and receive alerts if they exceed their budget or fall behind on savings targets.

This app is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and stores data temporarily in memory (with future plans to persist it using JSON Server or localStorage). It runs entirely on the frontend without reloading pages and is deployed via Render.
